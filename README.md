# Boot-Camp-Ten-Project
This repo contains an implementation of a console pomodoro timer in python


A Pomodoro Timer is a simply a timer that is used for time management using The Pomodoro Technique which is basically a time management philosophy that aims to provide the user with maximum focus and creative freshness, thereby allowing them to complete projects faster with less mental fatigue. The process is simple. For every project throughout the day, you budget your time into short increments and take breaks periodically. You work for 25 minutes, then take break for five minutes. After four “pomodoros” have passed, (100 minutes of work time with 15 minutes of break time) you then take a 15–20 minute break. Every time you finish a pomodoro, you mark your progress with an “X”, and note the number of times you had the impulse to procrastinate or switch gears to work on another task for each 25-minute chunk of time.

The app is currently only suppotred on linux platforms.
To run the app, you must have the following modules installed:

urwid     :- pip install urwid.

pyfiglet  :- pip install pyfiglet.

colorama  :- pip install colorama.

You also need to install the sox library which is availble for free

After that, just run pomodoro_main.py and you're good to fo.
